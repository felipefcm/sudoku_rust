# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a simple backtracking Sudoku solver.
I created it mainly to learn Rust, so there's probably a lot of room for improvement.

Running the binary crate with `cargo run` will try to load a `puzzles.csv` file with pairs of games and solutions.

There's a great dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanpark/sudoku).
